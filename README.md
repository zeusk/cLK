>cLK is a homebrew bootloader which will allow you to boot into android directly on your windows mobile phone.

- cLK boots a tad faster than magldr as it does not wait for radio processor on boot.
- cLK is open source so you can give/take what you want and learn stuff while doing so.
- cLK has Partitioning tools inbuilt, you'll never have to hook your phone to a computer ever again, just for flashing a rom!
- cLK has recovery inbuilt for users with broken usb port.
- cLK supports off-mode charging
